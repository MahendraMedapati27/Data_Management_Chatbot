# Azure App Service Configuration Fix

## Issue
Azure is looking for `startup.py` but can't find it during deployment.

## Solution
The issue is likely that Azure App Service is configured to use `startup.py` as the startup command, but the deployment process isn't including it properly.

## Fix Steps

### 1. Update Azure App Service Startup Command
Go to Azure Portal → App Services → my-chatbot-app-73d666 → Configuration → General settings:

**Startup Command**: `python startup.py`

### 2. Alternative: Use run.py instead
If startup.py continues to have issues, change the startup command to:
**Startup Command**: `python run.py`

### 3. Verify File Structure
Make sure these files are in the root directory:
- ✅ startup.py
- ✅ run.py  
- ✅ requirements.txt
- ✅ app/ directory
- ✅ templates/ directory
- ✅ static/ directory

### 4. Manual Deployment Test
If GitHub Actions continues to fail, try manual deployment:

```bash
# Install Azure CLI
az login

# Deploy manually
az webapp deployment source config --resource-group chatbot-rg --name my-chatbot-app-73d666 --repo-url https://github.com/MahendraMedapati27/Data_Management_Chatbot.git --branch main --manual-integration
```

## Expected Result
After fixing, the logs should show:
```
