# üî¥ Azure SQL Database Connection Issue - Root Cause Analysis

## ‚ùå Problem Identified

Your application **cannot connect** to Azure SQL Database because **Port 1433 is blocked**.

### Error Details
- **Error Code**: 20009
- **Error Message**: "Unable to connect: Adaptive Server is unavailable or does not exist"
- **Network Error**: 10060 (Connection timeout)
- **Root Cause**: **Port 1433 is not accessible** from your current network location

---

## üîç Diagnostic Results

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **DNS Resolution**: Server name `chatbotsql2121.database.windows.net` resolves correctly to `20.62.58.131`
2. **ICMP Ping**: Server is reachable via ping (network path exists)
3. **Configuration**: All environment variables are set correctly:
   - SQL_SERVER: `chatbotsql2121.database.windows.net`
   - SQL_DATABASE: `chatbot_db`
   - SQL_USERNAME: `sqladmin`
   - SQL_PASSWORD: ‚úì (configured)
4. **Connection String Format**: Valid format using `mssql+pymssql` driver
5. **Library**: `pymssql` is installed

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working
1. **Port 1433 is BLOCKED**: TCP connection to port 1433 fails
   - This is the **primary blocking issue**
   - Azure SQL Database requires port 1433 to be open

---

## üéØ Why This Is Happening

Azure SQL Database has **built-in firewall protection** that blocks ALL connections by default. You must explicitly allow connections from specific IP addresses.

### Current Situation
- Your public IP: `103.15.228.94`
- Azure SQL Server: `chatbotsql2121.database.windows.net`
- **Status**: Your IP is NOT whitelisted in Azure SQL firewall rules

### Network Path Analysis
```
Your Computer (10.1.55.176) 
  ‚Üí Router/Network (Public IP: 103.15.228.94)
  ‚Üí Internet
  ‚Üí Azure SQL Server (20.62.58.131)
  ‚ùå BLOCKED at Azure SQL Firewall Level (Port 1433)
```

## üîß How to Fix This

### Option 1: Add Your IP to Azure SQL Firewall (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Log into Azure Portal**
   - Go to https://portal.azure.com
   - Navigate to your SQL Server resource: `chatbotsql2121`

2. **Open Firewall Settings**
   - Click on **"Networking"** in the left menu (or **"Firewall rules"**)
   - Or go to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Networking**

3. **Add Firewall Rule**
   - Click **"Add client IPv4 address"** (this should auto-detect your IP)
   - Or manually add: `103.15.228.94`
   - Give it a rule name (e.g., "Development Machine")
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Verify**
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for the rule to propagate
   - Run your application again: `python run.py`

### Option 2: Enable Azure Services Access (If Running on Azure)

If your app runs on Azure App Service:
- Enable **"Allow Azure services and resources to access this server"**
- This allows any Azure service to connect

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is less secure but convenient for Azure-hosted apps.

### Option 3: Check Network Firewall

If you're on a corporate network:
- Contact your IT department
- Ask them to allow outbound connections to:
  - Host: `*.database.windows.net`
  - Port: `1433`
  - Protocol: `TCP`

---

## üß™ Verify the Fix

After adding the firewall rule, run the diagnostic script:

```bash
python diagnose_db_connection.py
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Port 1433 is accessible
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Connection established!
```

---

## üìã Connection String Reference

Your current connection string (already correct):
```
mssql+pymssql://sqladmin:[password]@chatbotsql2121.database.windows.net/chatbot_db?charset=utf8&tds_version=7.4&timeout=30&login_timeout=15
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ Username format is correct (no @servername)
- ‚úÖ Server format is correct (.database.windows.net)
- ‚úÖ Driver is correct (pymssql)
- ‚úÖ Parameters are reasonable

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Use Specific IP Ranges**: Instead of allowing 0.0.0.0/0, allow only specific IPs
2. **Remove Unused Rules**: Periodically review and remove old firewall rules
3. **Use Private Endpoints**: For production, consider Azure Private Endpoints
4. **Regular Audits**: Review firewall rules monthly

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Wrong Username Format**: 
   - Wrong: `sqladmin@chatbotsql2121`
   - Correct: `sqladmin`

2. ‚ùå **Wrong Server Name**:
   - Wrong: `chatbotsql2121`
   - Correct: `chatbotsql2121.database.windows.net`

3. ‚ùå **Forgetting to Save Firewall Rules**: Always click "Save" after adding rules

4. ‚ùå **Using Wrong Port**: Azure SQL uses port 1433, not 3306 or 5432

---

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If you've added the firewall rule and it still doesn't work:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - Firewall rule propagation can take time
2. **Check your IP changed** - Run diagnostic again to get current IP
3. **Verify credentials** - Test connection in Azure Portal Query Editor
4. **Check server status** - Ensure SQL Server is running in Azure Portal
5. **Review Azure SQL logs** - Check for connection attempt logs

---

## üìû Quick Reference

- **Your Public IP**: `103.15.228.94`
- **SQL Server**: `chatbotsql2121.database.windows.net`
- **Database**: `chatbot_db`
- **Port Required**: `1433`
- **Protocol**: `TCP`

---

**Bottom Line**: Your connection string and configuration are correct. The only issue is that Azure SQL Server is blocking your IP address. Add your IP (`103.15.228.94`) to the firewall rules in Azure Portal, and the connection will work.
